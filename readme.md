#FluentBuilderGenerator

The FluentBuilderGenerator generate builders (based on the Builder Pattern) for object creation for unit testing. With help of these generated classes it is possible to create custom objects in a fluent syntax style. The generator is implementation of javax.annotation.processing.AbstractProcessor
 from [Annotation Processing Tool](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/apt/) and it can be used with Maven, Gradle, Ant or just Eclipse.

After the fork from [BLUECARAT AG](https://github.com/bluecarat/fluentbuilder) many changes was merged to this project and released in 1.1.0 version. Some of them are implemented in a diffrent way, so check the changlelog.
